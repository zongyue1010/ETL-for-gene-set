stage:
1. data cleaning and preprocessing
[ ] download all the datasets listed in the shared table
1.2. check missing or any low quality data to be discarded
1.3. create a pipeline to extract the data with designated attributes from PAGER
3. analysis to describe the data
2.1. detect overlapped gene sets from indivisual data source (prioritize the most urgent in need for running GOLDEN fusion)
2.2. GOLDEN fusion to run and generate the super-PAGs (default parameters or customized parameters for potential better results: curve of the convergency)
2.3. the processed data upload to PAGER database
4. parallelly process the data in a large scale
3.1. create a pipeline to process bulk data and compare the performance
3.2. generate the final metrics in showing the newly generated super-PAGs performance
3.3. case studies for using super-PAGs from our results and implement to PAG-agent.
