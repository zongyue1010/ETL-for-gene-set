stage:
1. data cleaning and preprocessing
- [ ] download all the datasets listed in the shared table
- [ ] check missing or any low quality data to be discarded
- [ ] create a pipeline to extract the data with designated attributes from PAGER
2. analysis to describe the data
- [ ] detect overlapped gene sets from indivisual data source (prioritize the most urgent in need for running GOLDEN fusion)
- [ ] GOLDEN fusion to run and generate the super-PAGs (default parameters or customized parameters for potential better results: curve of the convergency)
- [ ] the processed data upload to PAGER database
3. parallelly process the data in a large scale
- [ ] create a pipeline to process bulk data and compare the performance
- [ ] generate the final metrics in showing the newly generated super-PAGs performance
- [ ] case studies for using super-PAGs from our results and implement to PAG-agent.
